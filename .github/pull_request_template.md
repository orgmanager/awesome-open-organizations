# By submitting this pull request I confirm I've read and complied with the below requirements.

Failure to properly do so will just result in the pull request being closed and everyone's time wasted. Please read it twice. Most people miss many things.

- I have read and understood the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/orgmanager/awesome-open-organizations/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
- This pull request has a descriptive title. For example, `Add Name of Organization`, not `Update readme.md` or `Add organization`.
- The entry in the Awesome list should include a short description about the list project/theme (not the list itself), and should be added at the bottom of the appropriate category.
- The organization I added
	- **has been around for at least 30 days,**
	- is the result of hard work and is the best I could possibly produce,
	- is a non-generated Markdown file in a GitHub repo,
	- is not a duplicate,
	- includes a succinct description of the project/theme at the top ([example](https://github.com/willempienaar/awesome-quantified-self)),
